        <h1>What is File Link?</h1>
        <p>File sharing has always been a hassle. From floppy disks to flash drives, physical file transfer options waste time and are tricky to send over long distances. Unfortunately, online alternatives aren't great either. A majority of group chat and team-collaboration services can't handle larger files. Sending files through email gets tricky when you are dealing with big teams.</p>
        <p>File Link was created to offer an alternative to these outdated methods. File Link is a free-to-use and completely online file sharing service. User files can be quickly transformed into shareable download links with three simple steps.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>At the home page, press the "Choose File" button and select the file you'd like to share (or drag it to the button).</li>
            <li>Press the "Submit" button to the right of where you uploaded your file. This will generate a shareable URL.</li>
            <li>Your link will appear in the box below. You can copy it with the "Copy to Clipboard" button.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>With just this, you can send your link to friends. They will be able to download your file simply by opening the link.</p>

        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p>File Link is a simple service, but just in case you have questions, I've got you covered!</p><p>
        <h2>Who is File Link meant for?</h2>
        <p>File Link is meant to be used by anyone looking for a simple way to send files. It is a service that can be benefitial to students, teachers, businesses, employees, and friend groups. Whether the need is professional or casual, File Link can reliably save you time.</p>
        <h2>Who can access my files?</h2>
        <p>Only files entered into File Link will be accessible through generated download links. Links cannot contain more than one file. In order to send multiple files, zipping a folder is recommended.</p>
        <p>Generated links are only visible to the user who generated them and the people that receive the link. URLs are randomly generated and will expire after a week.</p>
        <h2>Is File Link safe to use?</h2>
        <p>File Link is a safe method of file transfer assuming that the people users share their links with are trustworthy. Users should not share their link with strangers. Recipients of shared links should refrain from granting the link to others without the permission of the user that generated the link.</p>
        <h2>What options might be added in the future?</h2>
        <p>I have considered many options that could be added to File Link. Implementing a user login system would allow me to implement a whitelist system in which users may choose to limit access to their links to trusted accounts. I would also be able to give users the ability to choose when/if their links expire.</p>
        <p> Additionally, I have considered adding an optional password system for generated links, adding another layer of security for concerned users.</p>
